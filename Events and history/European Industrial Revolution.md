The European Industrial Revolution began in the 1760's and lasted sometime in the 1930's.

It began when people started to realise the use of steam in creating mechanical power for example in trains and ships.
Over the course of the Industrial Revolution the quality of manufaturing materials was greatly increased due to the use of machines in refining these materials.
Before the European Industrial Revolution India, China and the Middle East where considered to be the most advanced civilisations, 
   however their advancement had stagnated allowing Europe to catch up and even surpass them, 
   thanks in part to the technologies that had already been developed by India, China and the Middle east
