# History

Sociology is a Social Science that can trace it's origins and inspiration to many points during history 

* Ancient Greek Philosophy

> While Philosophy is a different from Sociology, it has had a large influence on it and so any discussion of Sociology would be amiss without also discussing Philosophy

In ancient Greece there were many Philisophical thinkers; such as Socraties and Plato, who placed a great emphasis on understanding the world around them by challenging prior knowledge

The socratic method, created by Plato, was an exercise in which Plato challenged a known master of a topic and proved their beliefs to be contradictory in order to gain a greater understanding of the topic at hand

* Modern Sociology

Modern Sociology however first came about during the [European Age of Enlightment](../main/Events%20and%20History/European%20Enlightenment.md), when the [European Industrial Revolution](../main/Events%20and%20History/European%20Industrial%20Revolution.md) changed how people lead their lives
  suddenly people could afford to contemplate the world and the people around them.
